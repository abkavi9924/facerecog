Have used predefined model, but ik how it works

a photo is taken as input and then it is coverted into an array using numpy
After converting it into an array the every pixel get its location in number form and the face recognition model does nothing but finds the location where a face can be detected and mark a rectangle around it.
This model basically has been taught where at what location the face can be and the similarity in human faces' location in array form.
All it does is catch the location and mark it.
